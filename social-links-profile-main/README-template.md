## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I learned a lot of ways to center a div! Funnily enough, I always forget how, but after this project I think I will remember! I also got a refresher on button styling and states.

### Continued development

I would like to redesign this to have my own information and links. Right now, there are no links to the buttons, since this was just for styling practice. I would like to go a step further and personalize it.
